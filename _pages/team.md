# Principal Investigator

## Ili Ma
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" src="../assets/images/Ili_ERC2.jpg" width="150/"/>
I am an assistant professor at Leiden University. My research aims to understand the processes that underlie how adolescents form beliefs and how these guide their decisions. I am particularly interested in adolescents' susceptiblity to disinformation and the affective, social, and cognitive processes that shape false beliefs. I am committed to providing a supportive, inclusive, and collaborative environment for the members of my lab. As a member of the faculty council, I advocate for sustainable practices in research and education, and supportive learning environments for students.

Daniel investigates how adolescents and young adults update their beliefs when consuming information on social media. Using a Bayesian framework, he examines how uncertainty, along with source and message characteristics, shape belief updates and susceptibility to misinformation among the youth. Co-advised by Wouter van den Bos (UvA).

## Jaime Vigil
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" src="../assets/images/Jaime.jpeg" width="150"/>
Jaime is deeply interested in cognitive computational modelling of social decision-making. His project focusses on how adolescents learn about other people's latent motives that drive their social decisions. He uses a series of behavioral economic games and computational models to understand this process.
