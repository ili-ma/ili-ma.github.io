# Principal Investigator

## Ili Ma
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" src="../assets/images/Ili_ERC2.jpg" width="150/"/>
I am an assistant professor at Leiden University. My research aims to understand the processes that underlie how adolescents form beliefs and how these guide their decisions. I am particularly interested in adolescents' susceptiblity to disinformation and the affective, social, and cognitive processes that shape false beliefs. I am committed to providing a supportive, inclusive, and collaborative environment for the members of my lab. As a member of the faculty council, I advocate for sustainable practices in research and education, and supportive learning environments for students.

Selin is interested in how uncertainty drives learning and decision-making processes and how this might be affected by anxiety. She approaches this important topic from different perspectives, using behavioral experiments and computational models. Advisors: Anna van Duijvenvoorde, Henk van Steenbergen, and Ellen de Bruijn.

Daniel investigates how adolescents and young adults update their beliefs when consuming information on social media. Using a Bayesian framework, he examines how uncertainty, along with source and message characteristics, shape belief updates and susceptibility to misinformation among the youth. Co-advised with Wouter van den Bos (UvA).

# Research master students
## Jaime Vigil
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" src="../assets/images/Jaime.jpeg" width="150"/>
Jaime is deeply interested in cognitive computational modelling of social decision-making. His project focusses on how adolescents learn about other people's latent motives that drive their social decisions. He uses a series of behavioral economic games and computational models to understand this process.
