excerpt: "Belief updates about the trustworthiness of peers are essential during adolescence as social reorientation emerges and peer relationships intensify. We used computational modelling and an information sampling paradigm to reveal that three cognitive mechanisms contribute to age-related changes in those belief updates: prior beliefs, prior uncertainty, and uncertainty tolerance. These age-related changes result in increasingly efficient belief updates from early to mid-adolescence. Our findings shed light on age-related changes in adaptive learning about others during adolescence.
